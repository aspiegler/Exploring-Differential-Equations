# Preface {.unnumbered}

---

This collection of interactive Jupyter notebooks are intended as a set of activities for exploring models of differential equations and understanding their solutions (numerical, graphical, and analytical). Topics covered by these materials include first and second order differential equations, Laplace transforms, and systems of equations (linear and nonlinear). These materials serves as the textbook for the "MATH 3200: Elementary Differential Equations" course at University of Colorado Denver.


## How to Access, Edit and Save Notebooks

---

This [html version](https://aspiegler.github.io/Exploring-Differential-Equations/) of the materials is not dynamic. You cannot edit the text or run code with the html version.

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://githubtocolab.com/CU-Denver-MathStats-OER/ODEs/blob/main/Chp1/01-What-is-a-Differential-Equation.ipynb)<nbsp>

- At the top of each notebook is a "button" such as the one above.
- Click the button to open an interactive Jupyter notebook version in [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) (or Colab).
- You can begin working with the notebook right away in Colab! There is no software to install (or purchase!).
- You can also access the materials directly on GitHub at <https://github.com/CU-Denver-MathStats-OER/ODEs.git>.


Each Jupyter notebook contains both narrative text (in Markdown cells) and Python code cells that you can create, modify, and run. 

::: {.callout-caution}
Although you do not need a Google account to interact with the notebooks, the Colab notebooks are "shared", meaning you cannot save any changes to the initial shared document that opens. **If you would like to save your changes, you first need to save a copy to your Google Drive.** Then you can edit and save changes to your own version.

## What Programming Background is Required?

---


No prior experience or knowledge of Python, Markdown, LaTeX, or Colaboratory is assumed or required to begin working with these materials. After working with these materials, you will have some knowledge and experience with Python, Markdown, LaTeX, and Colaboratory!

- [Welcome to Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) is a helpful notebook (with videos) to help introduce you to Colab.
- Here's a helpful [Markdown guide](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/markdown_guide.ipynb)


### What is Python?

---

We will be using [Python](https://www.python.org/) as a tool for experimenting with differential equations. Python is a widely used programming language suited for many purposes and applications such as computational mathematics, data science, and app development. We will create, modify, and run Python code in Jupyter notebooks. **No prior programming experience is required to begin working in Python in these materials.**

The goal of these materials are to investigate differential equations, not learn how to be an expert Python coder. The hope is that we can use Python as a tool for experimenting and gaining insight into  differential equations, and in the process, gain a familiarity with Python and coding so it is no longer a barrier. Have I mentioned **no prior programming experience is required to begin working in Python in these materials**?

There are two Python modules (`ode_tools.py` and `mass_spring.py`) that accompany these materials with scripts to perform certain tasks such as plotting slope fields, Euler's method, plotting phase planes, and widgets for experimenting with mass-spring systems. Whenever these modules are used, instructions are provided. There are more detailed instructions found:

- [Quick Reference for Python Functions: Chapter 1](https://githubtocolab.com/CU-Denver-MathStats-OER/ODEs/blob/main/Chp1/ODE-Tools-Tutorial.ipynb)
- [Quick Reference for Python Functions: Chapter 2](https://githubtocolab.com/CU-Denver-MathStats-OER/ODEs/blob/main/Chp2/Mass-Spring-Tutorial.ipynb)
- [Quick Reference for Python Functions: Chapter 3](https://githubtocolab.com/CU-Denver-MathStats-OER/ODEs/blob/main/Chp3/Phase-Portraits-Tutorial.ipynb)




### What is LaTex?

---

[LaTeX](https://www.cmor-faculty.rice.edu/~heinken/latex/symbols.pdf) is a system for rendering nice looking mathematical symbols, expressions, and equations. All of the mathematical notation in these materials are created using LaTeX. You can view and edit all of the LaTeX code in the Markdown cells. You do not need to become an expert in LaTeX, but having a familiarity with LaTeX is quite helpful and LaTeX can be used to typeset math in a number of different applications.

- Here is a useful [dictionary of LaTeX math symbols](https://www.cmor-faculty.rice.edu/~heinken/latex/symbols.pdf) to get a glimpse of LaTeX.


## A Remix of Inquiry-Oriented Differential Equations

---

Prior to creating these notebooks, I was teaching differential equation using Inquiry-Oriented Differential Equations (IODE) by Rasmussen, C., Keene, K. A., Dunmyre, J., & Fortune, N. IODE course materials are available at <https://iode.sdsu.edu>. The IODE content has been kindly shared by the authors for revising, remixing and redistributing.

- Some notebooks in these collection are not based on IODE content.
- Some notebooks are almost identical with IODE content. 
- Some sections are modifications of IODE materials.


## Supplemental OER Texts

--- 

Below are two suggested Open Education Resources (OER) texts for a first course in differential equations for further reading.

- [Notes on Diffy Qs: Differential Equations for Engineers](https://www.jirka.org/diffyqs/) by Jiri Lebl.
- [Elementary Differential Equations](https://digitalcommons.trinity.edu/mono/8/) by William F. Trench
